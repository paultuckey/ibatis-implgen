#summary General overview and reasoning

= Simplify the use SQL in Java =

A typical J2EE web application developer needs the following skills:
  * CSS
  * JavaScript
  * HTML
  * JSP Expression Language (EL)
  * JSTL (probably plus many other taglibs)
  * MVC Framework (struts etc)
  * Java
  * Persistence Framework
  * SQL

This is not exactly a short list. It would be goot to try and reduce this
(and not create a new language or framework in the process)

== Requirements: ==

  * Ability to easily cut and paste SQL into "proper" sql development tool (Toad, Embarcadero etc).
  * Don't repeat marshaling instructions

<p class="question">I want my DBA/SQL team to write sql for java app why would I want to put SQL in java files.</p>

<p class="answer">Use stored procedures or functions.
    This creates a very clear definition between teams.
    The Java team can maintain the calls to the procs and the SQL team the procs themselves.</p>
